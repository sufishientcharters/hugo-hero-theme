# Installation

### Install Hugo

To use this theme you will need to have Hugo installed. If you don't already have Hugo installed please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

### Check Hugo version (Hugo 0.51+ Extended is required)

This theme uses [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/) to compile SCSS and minify assets. Please make sure you have the **Hugo Extended** version installed. If you are not using the extended version this theme will not not compile.

To check your version of Hugo, run:

```
hugo version
```

This will output the currently installed version of Hugo. Make sure you see `/extended` after the version number, for example `Hugo Static Site Generator v0.51/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown` You do not need to use version v0.51 specifically, you can use any version of Hugo above 0.51. It just needs to have the `/extended` part

### Create a new Hugo site

```
hugo new site mynewsite
```

This will create a fresh Hugo site in the folder `mynewsite`.

### Install theme with Git

Clone this repo into the themes folder

```
cd mynewsite
git clone https://github.com/jugglerx/hugo-hero-theme.git themes/hugo-hero-theme
```

### Install theme from .zip file

You can download the .zip file located here https://github.com/JugglerX/hugo-hero-theme/archive/master.zip.

Extract the downloaded .zip inside the `themes` folder. Rename the extracted folder from `hugo-hero-theme-master` -> `hugo-hero-theme`. You should end up with the following folder structure `mynewsite/themes/hugo-hero-theme`

### Copy example content

Copy the entire contents of the `mynewsite/themes/hugo-hero-theme/exampleSite/` folder to root folder of your Hugo site, ie `mynewsite/`

To copy the files using terminal, make sure you are still in the projects root, ie the `mynewsite` folder.

```
cp -a themes/hugo-hero-theme/exampleSite/. .
```

### Update config.toml

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`, `themesDir` and `theme` values in `mynewsite/config.toml`

```
baseURL = "/"
themesDir = "themes"
theme = "hugo-hero-theme"
```

### Run Hugo

After installing the theme for the first time, generate the Hugo site.

You run this command from the root folder of your Hugo site ie `mynewsite/`

```
hugo
```

For local development run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

# Configuration

### Homepage meta tags

Often a homepage requires special meta tags such as a meta description or og meta data for twitter, facebook etc. You can configure these values in the `config.toml`

```
// config.toml
...

  [params.homepage_meta_tags]
    meta_description = "a description of your website."
    meta_og_title = "My Theme"
    meta_og_type = "website"
    meta_og_url = "https://www.mywebsite.com"
    meta_og_image = "https://www.mywebsite.com/images/tn.png"
    meta_og_description = "a description of your website."
    meta_twitter_card = "summary"
    meta_twitter_site = "@mytwitterhandle"
    meta_twitter_creator = "@mytwitterhandle"

```

### Set meta tags on a per layout basis

You can set meta tags on a per template basis using a block. For example, you might want to write a custom meta description for the `/charters` page. You can insert any valid HTML meta data inside the `{{ define "meta_tags }}` block at the top of a template.

```
// layouts/charters/list.html
...

{{ define "meta_tags" }}
    <meta name="description" content="We offer a variety of charters" />
{{ end }}

{{ define main }}
...
```

### Google Analytics

Add you google analytics ID to the `config.toml`

```
// config.toml
[params]
  google_analytics_id="UA-132398315-1"
```

### Menu

You can edit and add main menu links in the `config.toml` under `[[menu.main]]`

# Deploying to Netlify

This theme includes a `netlify.toml` which is configured to deploy to Netlify from the `exampleSite` folder. See this discussion on how to deploy your site on Netlify from the `exampleSite` folder - https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/deploy-your-theme-to-netlify/15508

Most likely if you are deploying to Netlify and created a new Hugo site or added this theme to an existing Hugo site then you are not deploying from the `exampleSite` directory and you can delete the `netlify.toml` file.

If you fork or copy this theme the LICENSE file and the copyright notice on line 3 (where I am listed as the author) must not be changed. You cannot just replace the copyright line with your own name. Attribution in your README.md or on your site is also welcome but not required.
